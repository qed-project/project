## Authorship

This preliminary discussion of project QED (very tentative name) is an amalgam of many ideas that many people have had and for which perhaps no one alive today deserves much credit. We are deliberately avoiding any authorship or institutional affiliation at this early stage in the project (and may decide to do so forever) in the hope that many will want to join in the project as principals, even as originators (to the extent that anyone alive today could be thought to be an originator of this project). Some of those involved in the project would much rather that QED be completed than that they, as individuals, be lucky enough to partake significantly in the project, much less get any public credit for its completion. It may seem paranoid to avoid personalities, but we are inspired by the extraordinary cooperation achieved in the Bourbaki series in an atmosphere of anonymity.
